## Profile
Bioscience Engineer with an additional Master's in Artificial Intelligence, combining expertise in life sciences with computational skills. I have applied AI across diverse domains, from medical imaging in ophthalmology to biosignal and activity recognition, with a focus on improving disease detection, monitoring, and decision-making. My interdisciplinary research integrates deep learning, image analysis, and signal processing, with experience in foundation model fine-tuning, multimodal data fusion, and development of custom loss functions. I bring strong problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills, developed through interdisciplinary research.

## Skills

**Computer Vision:** semantic segmentation (SwinV2), activity recognition (YOLOv8 + motion detection), disease classification (Alzheimer, Glaucoma), annotation platforms (Lirot.AI) video, hyperspectral imaging, feature extraction (e.g. texture)

**ML/AI:** theoretical foundation in ML, DL, NLP, CV (CNNs, ViT, VLM), following latest research in CV (e.g. DINOv3) and open-source models (HuggingFace)

**Communication & Languages:** scientific writing & presentations, cross-disciplinary teamwork (Life sciences & computer science); Dutch (native), English (fluent)

**Software Engineering:** Python (PyTorch, OpenCV), testing (pytest); CI/CD (Git/GitLab), model export (ONNX)
