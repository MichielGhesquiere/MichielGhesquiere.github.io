Hi there! I am Michiel. 👋

I am a Bioscience Engineer with an additional Master's in Artificial Intelligence, combining expertise in life sciences with computational skills. Currently I am working as a Data Scientist at Sentigrate, developing AI solutions for mental health monitoring. Previously, I conducted interdisciplinary research within the Research Group Ophthalmology and the Biomedical Signal Processing lab (STADIUS) at KU Leuven. 

My work sits at the fascinating intersection of **AI and life sciences**, where I apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world biological challenges. I have applied AI across diverse domains, from medical imaging in ophthalmology to biosignal and activity recognition, with a focus on improving disease detection, monitoring, and decision-making.
