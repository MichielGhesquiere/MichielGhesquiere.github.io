Hi there! I am Michiel.

I am an interdisciplinary researcher combining expertise in artificial intelligence and human health engineering. Currently I am pursuing a PhD within the Research Group Ophthalmology and the Biomedical Signal Processing lab (STADIUS) at KU Leuven. My work explores hyperspectral retinal imaging and deep learning as tools to detect neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma and Alzheimer’s disease.

### Research Experience

- **Jan 2024 – Present:** Interdisciplinary research between the Research Group Ophthalmology and Biomedical Signal Processing (BioMed, ESAT) using retinal imaging and AI to detect neurodegenerative diseases.
- **Aug – Sep 2023:** Research internship at Somnilog, Ghent studying the bi-directional link between sleep and dementia.
