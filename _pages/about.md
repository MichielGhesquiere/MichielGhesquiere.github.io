Hi there! I am Michiel.

I am a Bioscience Engineer with an additional Master's in Artificial Intelligence, combining expertise in life sciences with computational skills. Currently I am doing intderdisciplinary research within the Research Group Ophthalmology and the Biomedical Signal Processing lab (STADIUS) at KU Leuven. I have applied AI across diverse domains, from medical imaging in ophthalmology to biosignal and activity recognition, with a focus on improving disease detection, monitoring, and decision-making. My interdisciplinary research integrates deep learning, image analysis, and signal processing, with experience in foundation model fine-tuning, multimodal data fusion, and development of custom loss functions.
