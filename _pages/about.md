Hi there! I am Michiel. 👋

I am a Bioscience Engineer with an additional Master's in Artificial Intelligence, combining expertise in life sciences with computational skills. Currently I am doing interdisciplinary research within the Research Group Ophthalmology and the Biomedical Signal Processing lab (STADIUS) at KU Leuven. 

My work sits at the fascinating intersection of **AI and healthcare** 🏥🤖, where I apply cutting-edge machine learning techniques to solve real-world medical challenges. I have applied AI across diverse domains, from medical imaging in ophthalmology to biosignal and activity recognition, with a focus on improving disease detection, monitoring, and decision-making. 

## 🔬 What I Do

My interdisciplinary research integrates deep learning, image analysis, and signal processing, with hands-on experience in:
- **Foundation model fine-tuning** for medical applications
- **Multimodal data fusion** combining images, signals, and clinical data  
- **Custom loss function development** for topology preservation
- **Domain adaptation** across different imaging devices and populations

## 🎯 Research Impact

I'm particularly excited about developing AI systems that can make a real difference in healthcare. My recent work includes:
- Achieving **AUC 0.84** in early Alzheimer's detection using novel retinal biomarkers
- Discovering new texture features in hyperspectral retinal imaging
- Creating robust computer vision systems that work across different clinical settings
