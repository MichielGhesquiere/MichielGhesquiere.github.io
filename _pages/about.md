permalHi there! I am Michiel.

I am a Bioscience Engineer with an additional Master's in Artificial Intelligence, combining expertise in life sciences with computational skills. Currently I am pursuing a PhD within the Research Group Ophthalmology and the Biomedical Signal Processing lab (STADIUS) at KU Leuven. I have applied AI across diverse domains, from medical imaging in ophthalmology to biosignal and activity recognition, with a focus on improving disease detection, monitoring, and decision-making. My interdisciplinary research integrates deep learning, image analysis, and signal processing, with experience in foundation model fine-tuning, multimodal data fusion, and development of custom loss functions.: /

Hi there! I am Michiel.

I am an interdisciplinary researcher combining expertise in artificial intelligence and human health engineering. Currently I am pursuing a PhD within the Research Group Ophthalmology and the Biomedical Signal Processing lab (STADIUS) at KU Leuven. My work explores hyperspectral retinal imaging and deep learning as tools to detect neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma and Alzheimer’s disease.

### Research Experience

**Jan 2024 – Present:** Interdisciplinary research between the Research Group Ophthalmology and Biomedical Signal Processing (BioMed, ESAT)
- Multimodal retinal imaging for early Alzheimer's disease detection: End-to-end pipeline (IQA, preprocessing, feature extraction, multimodal classification); best model achieved AUC 0.84. Found novel texture biomarkers in hyperspectral retinal imaging.
- Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Glaucoma Classification: Addressing domain shift across different imaging devices and demographics by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFM) pre-trained with self-supervised learning.
- Artery and vein segmentation in fundus image and video data: Implemented custom loss functions to preserve correct topology, ensuring temporal consistency in video segmentation.

**Aug – Sep 2023:** Research internship at Clouds of Care, Ghent studying the bi-directional link between sleep and dementia. Developing 1D-CNN for sleep spindle detection in EEG sleep data.
